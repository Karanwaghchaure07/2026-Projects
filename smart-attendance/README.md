# Smart Attendance System using Face Recognition

This project uses computer vision to automatically mark attendance
using real-time face recognition through a webcam.

## Features
- Face detection using OpenCV
- Face recognition of registered users
- Automatic attendance marking
- Attendance stored in CSV file
- Prevents duplicate attendance on the same day

## Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- NumPy

## Demo
1. Run face capture to register users
2. Train the face recognition model
3. Show face to webcam
4. Attendance is marked in CSV file

## Note
Face data used in this project is for educational purposes only.
